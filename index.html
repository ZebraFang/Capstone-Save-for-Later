            Web development involves the work of either creating static web
            pages or complex programs, social media apps or ecommerce platforms
            for the World Wide Web (internet). Although web development can
            include design, engineering, web servers and security, “web
            development” usually refers to the main non-design aspects of
            building a website which includes writing markup and code.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Web developers usually code in 3 core languages; HTML, CSS and
            JavaScript but are not limited to only those three. This will be
            looked at later on. Impacts of web development can be seen from
            checking your Gmail to logging into Netflix through your web
            browser. As a web developer you can specialise into three fields,
            front-end(concerned with the visual aspects), back-end(deals with
            the server side, part of the site you cannot see or interact with)
            and fullstack(a combination of front-end and back-end).

            The internet is a system of interconnected computers initially
            commissioned by the United States Department of Defense to enable
            faster sharing of information and resources. In its infancy the
            internet worked more like an intranet where people connected to the
            department could access it but by the early 1990s modern businesses
            began to plug into it marking the beginning of the internet as we
            know it. A global network. Tim Berners-Lee is credited as the
            inventor of the World Wide Web and implemented the first browser and
            Web server.

            HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the skeleton
            building blocks of building a website. HTML enables you to add text,
            images, forms and even videos to your website. The earliest version
            of HTML has its roots in the latter part of 1990 when Tim
            Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser plus server
            software. We are currently on version 5 and it is managed by the Web
            Hypertext Application Technology Working Group or WHATWG. Check out

            Cascading Styling Sheets or CSS is a style sheet language which
            essentially focuses on the presentation of structured documents,
            usually HTML. It enables layout changes, different fonts, colour
            changes and even animations. The cascading part of the name refers
            to the priority scheme involved with styling rules. This helps
            determine which styling rule overwrite another and this is
            predictable. As an example setting the body tag in html to a certain
            font will cascade down to oter elements inside the body tag.Håkon
            Wium Lie and Bert Bos developed and helped CSS1 get released in
            1996. Two more versions have followed in the years up until CSS3. It
            is managed and developed by World Wide Web Consortium or W3C. Check

            JavaScript or JS is a logic programming language that along with
            HTML and CSS act as one one of the core languages in web
            development. As of 2022 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client
            side for webpage behaviour. JS truly helps make the webpage more
            interactive, such as changing a state or creating an action after
            clicking a button for example. This becomes more powerful with
            frameworks like React or Angular. Before JS web pages used to be
            very static.The first version was developed by Brendan Eich in 1995
            while he was with Netscape, one of the first popular web browsers.
            Since then it has gone on to have many versions and currently is
            officially JS ES6 released in 2015 and even this version has had a
            few more updates. It has become one of the most popular languages to
            code in. Check out this resource to learn more and how to use it.

        Frameworks in CSS or JavaScript are ready made components that can speed
        up the development process, it can in a way be thought of as lego blocks
        of code that you can add to your project. Which framework you decide on
        using depends on the project. React can make single web pages update
        instantaneously making them very dynamic. Below is just a sample size of
        the more popular frameworks.
